# Personal Injury Pre-Settlement Loans

These type of loans are given to victims involved in a personal injury lawsuit such as an automobile or work related accident. Very often the victim does not have money to pay for medical or living expenses as a result of the accident. Pre-Settlement Loan companies are willing to loan the money to the borrower in exchange for a high interest rate which will be collected along with the amount borrowed when the case gets settled. The benefit of these loans is that in most cases they do not need to be paid back, if the case is lost. The downside of these loans is that the interest charged is usually the highest interest allowed in the state where the loan is issued.

## Personal Injury Liens

Personal Injury Loans or Liens need to be tracked by the financial instituion issuing the loans. Primarily these lenders need to know the following:
* Who did they issue a long to
* How much did they lend
* What is the interest accumulated on the amount lend out

Tracking these expeneses in Excel is an obvious option. The challange comes with following up regarding these loans to find out the status of the underlying litigation. These status follow ups often involve calling or emailing the law firm which is litigating the accident.
